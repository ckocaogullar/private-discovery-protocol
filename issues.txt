## Secret is too long - cannot be encrypted using RSA. Combining AES session key with RSA

## In the discovery stage, the message that Alice sends to discovery servers is not structured like it is written in 
the document. Instead, it is ({ID_B}_sym, {sym}_pk)

## Having trouble with decrypting secrets encrypted with the AES symmetric key

## About DKIM: Is there any point in passing the registration email among servers

## Should we pass the request between discovery servers or send them seperate emails

## Responding in the absence of an answer
